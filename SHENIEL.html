        <h3><strong>Lyrics</strong></h3>
      
<p>I walked through the door with you, the air was cold</p>
<p>But something 'bout it felt like home somehow</p>
<p>And I left my scarf there at your sister's house</p>
<p>And you've still got it in your drawer, even now</p>

<p>Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze</p>
<p>We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate</p>
<p>Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place</p>
<p>And I can picture it after all these days</p>

<p>And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more</p>
<p>And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all, oh</p>

<p>'Cause there we are again on that little town street</p>
<p>You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me</p>
<p>Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well</p>

<p>Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red</p>
<p>You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed</p>
<p>And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team</p>
<p>You taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me</p>

<p>And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do</p>
<p>And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to</p>

<p>'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night</p>
<p>We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light</p>
<p>Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well</p>
<p>Yeah</p>

<p>And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much</p>
<p>But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up</p>
<p>Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well</p>

<p>And you call me up again just to break me like a promise</p>
<p>So casually cruel in the name of being honest</p>
<p>I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here</p>
<p>'Cause I remember it all, all, all</p>
<p>Too well</p>

<p>Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it</p>
<p>I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it</p>
<p>After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own</p>
<p>Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone</p>

<p>But you keep my old scarf from that very first week</p>
<p>'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me</p>
<p>You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well</p>

<p>'Cause there we are again when I loved you so</p>
<p>Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known</p>
<p>It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well</p>

<p>Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all</p>
<p>Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all</p>
<p>It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well</p>
